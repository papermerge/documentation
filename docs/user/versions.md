# Versions

Papermerge is a non-destructive DMS, which means you always have available
original document regardless how many transformations (page cut/paste, document
merges) you apply on the document.

Retention of the original is ensured because of document versioning feature.
With each extra transformation (page cut/paste) you apply - a new document
version is created.
