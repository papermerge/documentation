# Overview

{{ extra.project }} provides very powerful REST API.
In order to user REST API, you need REST API server URL and
user token.

REST server URL is the http address of your running instance.
HTTP address also include the scheme.

Examples of REST API server URLs:

- http://papermerge.homelab.dev
- https://papers.berlin

Currently there is no web UI to get token, the only way to get REST API
token is by running docker command. See [next section](./token.md) for details.
