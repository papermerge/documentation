In this sense - scanned documents, which are usually in PDF or TIFF format, are perfect match.</p> <p>PDF (Portable Document Format) is de facto standard for storing archived documents. In correct technical terms - it is PDF/A subset.

There three aspects of full backup:</p> <ul> <li>media directory</li> <li>database</li> <li>application version</li> </ul> <p>If all you want is to just to ensure safe copy of you documents then all you need to do is to backup media directory. If you want to create full snapshot (i.e you want to be able to restore full application state from specific moment in past) then you need media directory backup + database backup + Papermerge version of that specific moment in time.</p> <p>Media Directory ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> <p>Media directory is place where Papermerge application saves all your original documents and their derivatives (extracted text, images etc). By backing up your media directory - you ensure your documents are safe.  </p> <p>Media directory is configured with :ref:<code>media_dir</code> setting. By default it is a folder named \"media\" in of same directory where papermerge project was cloned.</p> <p>.. note::</p> <pre><code>:ref:`media_dir` has two subfolders *docs* and *results*. :ref:`media_dir`/docs is place where\noriginal documents are uploaded - it is the location you want to ensure is regularely backed up.\nMedia directory configuration is pure Django webframework thing; in Django it is called `MEDIA_ROOT &lt;https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#media-root&gt;`_\n</code></pre> <p>.. note::</p> <pre><code>**Papermerge never overwrites or renames original uploads!**, in that sense, Papermerge is non-destructive :ref:`dms`.

In database, Papermerge stores information like user related informations, documents' metadata, documents' tags etc.</p> <p>.. note::</p> <pre><code>Uploaded documents are NOT stored in database!

Extract archive:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Get mod_wsgi\n\n    unzip mod_wsgi-4.7.1\n    cd mod_wsgi-4.7.1\n\nStep 3 - Build &amp; Install mod_wsgi\n###################################\n\nIn order to build mod_wsgi on Ubuntu Linux, you need three things:\n\n* ``build-essential`` ubuntu package with gcc compiler and friends\n* ``apache2-dev`` package\n* ``python interpreter`` from your **papermerge virtual environment**\n\nLet's first install required packages::\n\n$ sudo apt install build-essential apache2-dev\n\nNext, activate your Papermerge virtual environment (python virtual environment):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Activate python virtual environment\n\n    $ source /opt/papermerge/.venv/bin/activate\n\n.. warning::\n\n    Activating python virtual environment is very important step. Because when\n    compilying mod_wsgi it must find in $PATH **python interpreter** located\n    in same virtual environment with other python dependencies.\n\nSwitch to extracted directory mod_wsgi-4.7.1 and run following commands:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Compile mod_wsgi\n\n    $ ./configure\n    $ make\n    $ sudo make install\n\nOn Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ``sudo make install`` command will copy ``mod_wsgi.so``\nbinary file to ``/usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so``\n\nNext enable mod_wsgi module with following command:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Enable mod_wsgi apache module\n\n    $ a2enmod mod_wsgi\n\nYou can double check if mod_wsgi module was enabled with:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Double check that apache module was indeed enabled\n\n    $ apachectl -M\n\nIt should display a list enabled modules. Among other should be:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Check if wsgi_module is listed as enabled\n\n    ...\n    wsgi_module (shared)  \n    ...\n\n\nStep 4 - Configure Virtual Host\n################################\n\nIn directory ``/etc/apache2/sites-available`` create a virtual configuration file for papermerge. \nLet's say papermerge.site. Here is configuration example for virtual host:\n\n.. code-block:: apacheconf\n    :caption: File /etc/apache2/sites-available/papermerge-site.conf\n\n    &lt;VirtualHost *:8060&gt;\n        &lt;Directory /opt/papermerge/config&gt;\n            Require all granted\n        &lt;/Directory&gt;\n\n        Alias /media/ /var/media/papermerge/\n        Alias /static/ /var/static/papermerge/\n\n        &lt;Directory /var/media/papermerge&gt;\n           Require all granted\n        &lt;/Directory&gt;\n\n        &lt;Directory /var/static/papermerge&gt;\n          Require all granted\n        &lt;/Directory&gt;\n\n        ServerName papermerge.home\n        ServerRoot /opt/papermerge\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n\n    WSGIPythonHome /opt/papermerge/.venv/\n    WSGIPythonPath /opt/papermerge/\n    WSGIScriptAlias / /opt/papermerge/config/wsgi.py\n\n\nThe first bit in the WSGIScriptAlias line is the base URL path you want to\nserve your application at (/ indicates the root url), and the second is the\nlocation of a WSGI file, inside papermerge project as ``config/wsgi.py``. This\ntells Apache to serve any request below the given URL using the WSGI\napplication defined in that file.\n\n``WSGIPythonHome`` is path to python's virtual environment.\n\nNginx + Gunicorn\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAnother way to deploy Papermerge behind a real web server is by using ``Nginx\n+ Gunicorn`` duo. `Gunicorn &lt;https://gunicorn.org/&gt;`_ is called application server - it serves WSGI\n(Papermerge/Django) application via HTTP protocol (in that sense Gunicorn is\nkind of web server). However, gunicorn cannot serve static content\n(JavaScript, CSS, images), this task falls on NginX shoulders.\n\nStep 1 - Install Gunicorn\n###########################\n\n`Gunicorn &lt;https://gunicorn.org/&gt;`_ is not provided in list of dependencies. Thus, you need to installed in your current\nvirtual python environment:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Activate python's virtual environment and install gunicorn\n\n    $ source .venv/bin/activate\n    $ pip install gunicorn\n\nCreate gunicorn configuration file:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    :caption: Content of /opt/etc/gunicorn.conf.py file\n\n    workers = 2\n    errorlog = \"/opt/log/gunicorn.error\"\n    accesslog = \"/opt/log/gunicorn.access\"\n    loglevel = \"debug\"\n\n    bind = [\"127.0.0.1:9001\"]\n\n.. note::\n\n    Gunicorn configuration file must have .py extention and its syntax is\n    valid python syntax.\n\n.. important:: \n\n    Binding port is 9001. This same port will be later used to proxy http\n    requests from nginx to gunicorn.\n\nand environment variables file:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    :caption: Content of /opt/etc/gunicorn.env file\n\n    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production\n\nYou need to create a production.py file in /opt/papermerge/config/setting/ directory.\nHere is an example of production.py file content:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    :caption: Content of /opt/papermerge/config/settings/production.py file\n\n    from .base import *  # noqa\n\n    DEBUG = False\n    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']\n\n\nStep 2 - Systemd Service for Gunicorn\n#######################################\n\nExample of systemd unit file for Gunicorn:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n    :caption: SystemD unit file for gunicorn\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Gunicorn Service\n\n    [Service]\n    WorkingDirectory=/opt/papermerge\n    EnvironmentFile=/opt/etc/gunicorn.env\n    ExecStart=/opt/papermerge/.venv/bin/gunicorn config.wsgi:application --config /opt/etc/gunicorn.conf.py\n\n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n\nStep 3 - Nginx\n################\n\nAnd finally connect nginx with gunicorn. Here is a sample configuration for nginx:\n\n.. code-block:: nginx.conf\n    :caption: Nginx configuration file\n\n    server {\n        server_name papermerge.home;\n        listen 9000;\n\n        location /static/ {\n            alias /opt/static/;\n        }\n\n        location /media/ {\n            alias /opt/media/;\n        }\n\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nWorker\n</code></pre> <p>Here is worker.service unit:</p> <p>.. code-block:: ini     :caption: Worker.service unit file</p> <pre><code>[Unit]\nDescription=Papermerge Worker\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/papermerge\nExecStart=/opt/papermerge/.venv/bin/python /opt/papermerge/manage.py worker --pidfile /tmp/worker.pid\nRestart=on-failure\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n</code></pre> <p>.. note::</p> <pre><code>Notice that ``ExecStart`` is **absolute path to python interpreter inside\npython virtual environment**. Absolute path to python interpreter inside\nvirtual environment is enough information for python to figure out the\nrest of python dependencies from the same virtual environment. Thus, you\ndon't need to provide futher information about virtual environment.\n</code></pre> <p>Systemd .service may be placed in one of several locations. One options is to place it in <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> together with other system level units. In this case you need root access permissions.</p> <p>Another option is to place .service file inside <code>$HOME/.config/systemd/user/</code> In this case you can start/check status/stop systemd unit service with following commands:</p> <p>.. code-block:: bash     :caption: Useful systemd comments</p> <pre><code>systemctl --user start worker\nsystemctl --user status worker\nsystemctl --user stop worker\n</code></pre> <p>.. _broker_config:</p> <p>Broker, Messaging Queue and their Configuration ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p> <p>Web application (a.k.a. main app) shows users fancy UI and is basically what end users see and interact with. Worker extracts information from scanned documents (:ref:<code>OCRs &lt;ocr&gt;</code> them) i.e workers actually do the most laborious task. Number of workers is only limited by your resources: there can be one  worker or one thousand.</p> <p>How does web application pass the heavy OCR jobs to the worker(s)? How does it happen that in case of many workers one starts the job and others are aware of it and do not start the same again - i.e. a job is never performed twice? All this workers management is done by a component called Broker. Passing of those OCR related jobs from main app to the broker (which in turn will pass it to correct worker) is done via so called Messaging Queue. Messaging queue can be something as simple as file system; but database, computer memory, key/value in-memory databases are also good candidates.</p> <p>The thing is, to keep initial setup very simple (i.e. to require the minimum amount of configuration to start the application) the broker part is performed by a package called celery - which is part of Papermerge. Similarly, to keep everything simple at the beginning message queue was chosen to be file system itself.</p> <p>By default, configurations for broker and messaging queue are following:</p> <p>.. code-block:: python     :caption: Don't use this options in production</p> <pre><code>CELERY_BROKER_URL = \"filesystem://\"\nCELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {\n    'data_folder_in': PAPERMERGE_TASK_QUEUE_DIR,\n    'data_folder_out': PAPERMERGE_TASK_QUEUE_DIR,\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Where <code>PAPERMERGE_TASK_QUEUE_DIR</code> points to the folder on the file system, and its default value is <code>queue</code>. Which basically means that all messages will be saved in the current folder named <code>queue</code>.</p> <p>Above configuration is fantastic for development, because zero configuration required.</p> <p>However, filesystem based broker configuration is terrible for production!</p> <p>If you will use it, you will experience CPU increase over time, like described in this <code>ticket &lt;https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/issues/198&gt;</code>_ on github. </p> <p>Following is good configuration for production:</p> <p>.. code-block:: python     :caption: Recommended options for production</p> <pre><code>CELERY_BROKER_URL = \"redis://\"\nCELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {}\nCELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = \"redis://localhost/0\"\n</code></pre> <p>It uses <code>redis &lt;https://redis.io/&gt;</code>_ key value database. With redis as broker transport you will never have CPU spikes.</p> <p>.. important::</p> <pre><code>``CELERY_BROKER_URL``, ``CELERY_BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS`` and\n``CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`` configurations go into django configuration file\nof Papermerge project not in papermerge.conf.py.
