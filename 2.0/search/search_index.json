For example receipts are perfect examples - you don't need to read receipts everyday, but eventually you will need them for your tax declaration. In this sense - scanned documents, which are usually in PDF or TIFF format, are perfect match.</p> <p>PDF (Portable Document Format) is de facto standard for storing archived documents. In correct technical terms - it is PDF/A subset. PDF/A differs from PDF by prohibiting features unsuitable for long-term archiving, such as font linking and encryption.</p> <p>Most of the modern office scanners will output scanned files in PDF/A format. This is why, PDF is practically synonymous for document in context of Papermerge.</p> <p>A picture made with your phone of a A4 paper document is regarded by Papermege as full fledged document, even though digitally it is stored as jpeg or png format. You can think of a picture made with a phone (of a document) as a bad quality scan.</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-not-a-document","title":"What is Not a Document?","text":"<p>Out of scope are Office documents (ODT, DOCX, spreadsheets, presentations etc), text files (notes); these files are usually editable i.e. user can alter the content of the document.
