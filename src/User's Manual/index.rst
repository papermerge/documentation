User's Manual
=============

|project| is designed to be very intuitive. Because its user interface
resembles a typical desktop file browser, you will be able to use |project|
for basic document management tasks with minimal training. However, don't be
mislead by easy to use interface, underneath simplicity, there is a powerful
tool which will bring your paperwork to the new level. |project| is a full
fledged document management system, not just a file browser, and to use it
efficiently you need to understand few high-level concepts.

detailed information.
