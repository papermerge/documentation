Upload Documents
================

|project| is used to store documents. Documents can originate from any source
i.e. you can upload documents from your local hard drive, from remote email
account, S3 object storage etc.

Actually |project| does not care where documents are coming from. All |project| does,
it exposes a REST API for :ref:`ingesting documents <ingesting_documents>`.

There are two options:

- upload directly via web user interface
- upload documents via REST API
