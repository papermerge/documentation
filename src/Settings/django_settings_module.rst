Django Settings Module
======================

|project| is written in `Django Web Framework`_. When you use Django, you have to tell it which settings youâ€™re using. Do this
by using an environment variable, DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE.


``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The value of DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE should be in Python path syntax, e.g.
mysite.settings. Note that the settings module should be on the Python import
search path.
This value is Django specific and can be passed only as environment
variable.
For |project|::

	DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings

and above value should not be changed unless you really know what you are doing.

.. note::
	``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable is the
	most important environment variable. It always must be
	present and set to value ``config.settings`` - otherwise
	application won't even start.
