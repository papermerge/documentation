Glossary
========

Here is a list of terms, expressions and abbreviations used in this
documentation. Many of terms here are specific for document management problem
domain.

.. _dms:

DMS
~~~

DMS = Document Management System

.. _digital_archive:


Digital Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Digital archive is a fancy name for a document whose content won't change
anymore. Think of PDF documents - they don't change in time unless you have specialized
software. PDF documents are a good example of digital archives.
Any scanned document is a digital archive.

.. note::

  Throughout Papermerge documentation terms **document**, **scanned document**, **pdf document**, **digital archive** are used interchangeble and mean the same thing.

.. _ocr:

OCR
~~~

Abbreviation from **optical character recognition**. OCR is the process of
extracting plain text (and associated information) from file, document or image.

Example: John takes a photo with his mobile phone of a paper based
bank statement. Let's say IBAN number appears on that document. From resulted
photo - filename *bank-statement.jpeg* - John won't be able to copy IBAN
number and paste it over whatsapp to his wife.

On the other hand, if the same bank statement photo is processed using optical
character recognition technology (OCR) - the text is extracted from the photo
(for example as bank-statement.txt file) and John can open bank-statement.txt
file, select IBAN number and copy/paste it in whatsapp chat to his wife.

OCR technology has widespread usage across many areas. It **enables computers
to understand pictures**. If computers understand what text is inside images,
then users can search for specific terms across photos.

Scanned document is a just photo of the document - usually of higher quality
than photos taken with mobile phones for example. Described with informal
terms scanners are specialized devices for taking photos of the documents.
