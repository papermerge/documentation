User Interface
===============

Papermerge user interface is designed to be very intuitive. However, it is a
good idea to know major interface areas by their name because they are
referenced many times in this manual.

    Figure 1. Main user interface elements

.. _ui_document_browser:

Document Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Figure 1. marked with number 1.

Document browser is designed to have similar look and feel of modern desktop
file browsers. This is the place where you browse your documents and folders.
The huge different between Papermerge's Document Browser  and usual desktop
environment's file managers (e.g. `Windows File Manager
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer>`_) is that in Papermerge there
are only two times of items - folders and documents. Documents are mainly PDF,
jpeg, png and tiff file formats. There is no such thing as audio files or
video files.

.. _ui_right_side_widgets_panel_in_doc_browser:

Right Side Widgets Panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Figure 1. marked with number 2.

Details of selected folder or document appear in so called Right Side Widgets
Panel or simply Widgets Panel. There may be many different widgets, but three
most important ones are:

* OCR Language Widget
* Info Widget
* Metadata Widget

.. figure:: ../img/user-manual/user-interface/widgets-panel.png

    Figure 2. Right Side Panel's Widgets display additional information about
    selected documents or folders.

OCR Language Widget will always be displayed (when in Document Browser). OCR
language indicates in which language your documents will be :ref:`OCRed <ocr>`.

Basic Info Widget displays basic information about currently selected document
or folder. Among basic information like title, owner and creation date, it
will display folder or document's associated tags. In Info Widget there is (an
extra obvious) download button. Note that with download button in Info Widget
you will download only latest version of selected document (or folder
content). In order to download older versions of the document you need to open
document in document viewer.

Metadata Widget will display metadata of the currently selected folder or document.


.. _ui_left_side_nav_menu:

Left Side Navigation Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Figure 1 marked with number 3.

This is main navigation menu. Immediately after sign in you will land in
*Documents* menu which will display :ref:`ui_document_browser`. Depending on
your role and permissions you may or may not see some menu items visible on
Left Side Navigation Menu illustrated in Figure 1. For example if you don't
have permissions to view/change other users, roles and groups - menu items
user, roles and groups won't be displayed.

.. _ui_user_menu:

User Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~

In Figure 1 marked with number 4.

It is almost a standard practice in almost any modern web applications to
place their user sign out, user preferences menus in upper left corner of the
application. In this regard Papermerge follows this best practice. Besides
usual ``Sign out`` and ``Preferences`` menu items there will be ``Change
Password`` menu item and link to (this) online Documentation. Depending on
your role and permissions you may see additional menu items.

.. _ui_breadcrumb:

Breadcrumb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Figure 1 marked with number 5.

.. figure:: ../img/user-manual/user-interface/breadcrumb.png

    Figure 3. Breadcrumb example. Indicates full path to currently opened document receipt_5.pdf

Breadcrumb indicates current (document or folder) path. It is usual part of any desktop
file manager to have one sort of "current path indicator" - it is just called differently.
For web applications such location indicator is usually called breadcrumb.

.. note::

    The term breadcrumb is a reference to the trail of bread crumbs left by Hansel and Gretel in the German fairy tale of the same name.

.. _ui_display_mode:

Display Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Figure 1 marked with number 6.

With display mode drop down menu you can switch between different modes in
which folders and documents will be displayed in :ref:`ui_document_browser`.
Currently two display modes are supported:

* list
* grid

Besides obvious visual difference there is one very important distinction
between two display modes: :ref:`metadata_metacolumns` are displayed only in
list mode.
