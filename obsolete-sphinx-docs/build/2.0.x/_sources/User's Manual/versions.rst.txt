Papermerge is a non-destructive :ref:`dms <dms>`, which means you always have
available original document regardless how many transformations (page cut/paste, document merges) you apply on the document.

Retention of the original is ensured because of document versioning feature. With each extra transformation (page cut/paste) you apply - a new document version is created.
