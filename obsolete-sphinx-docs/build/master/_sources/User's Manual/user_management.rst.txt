User Management
===============

|project| is multi user system. Each user has a specific set of permissions
which limits the of operations user is authorized to perform.

The most privileged user (which has all permissions) is called ``superuser``.
Brand new |project| instance ships with one default user - which happens to be
``superuser``. With default user, you can add as many users as you wish.

.. note:: You can add multiple ``superusers`` as well
