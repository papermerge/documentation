Changelog
=========

As |project| has many moving parts it is tricky to maintain one single
changelog for all components. This is why, you will find below URLs to
changelog files of each individual component.

Each individual changelog file is stored in project's source code repository and it
(the changelog file) is generated automatically for each new version of
respective component.
