User's Manual
===============

Papermerge is designed to be very intuitive. Because its user interface
resembles a typical desktop file browser, you will be able to use Papermerge
for basic document management tasks without any training at all. However,
don't be mislead by familiar user interface, underneath it, there is a
powerful tool which will bring your paperwork to the new level. Papermerge is
a full fledged document management system, not just a file browser, and to use it efficiently 
you need to understand few high-level concepts.
