    This feature is experimental.

Document pipelines is a way to apply extra transformations on incoming
documents. Using document pipelines capabilities, virtually any external file
type can be imported and stored as PDF
document (native format).

With document pipelines for example email messages for example can be imported
and stored as PDF files.

Each pipeline is an external plugin. 


.. warning::

    Although basic pipeline functionality is already part of core application, the whole concept is still experimental and undocumented.
